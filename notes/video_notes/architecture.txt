Top three use cases
  Healthcare
  Experts market
  Education
  Gaming
  Job Interviews

Multi-Party Topologies
  One to One + One
    3 person call
    Customer service + add an expert/supervisor
    Example Use case
      RBS: Royal Bank of Scotland
        Relationship with high net worth individuals
  Few to Few
    Group call with 4-6 people
    Business collaboration tool
    Example Use case
      Roll20
        Small group of people collectively playing a game
  Many to Many
    Large group call with up to 20 people
    Virtual classroom
    Example Use case
      Minerva
        Revolutionze education
        Learning platform for anyone to have education
        Creating a large classroom
          Students can dynamically raise their hands

Mesh Network Topology
  Every endpoint sends and receives media streams
    to and from every other endpoint
      bi-directional to each client
  Poor man's version of multi-party
  Pros
    Simple to implement
      every client talks to every other client
    No server infrastructure required
    Take advantage of P2P connections
  Cons
    Not scalabe for large # of participants
    Harder to scale to large # of subscribers
    Heavey burden on CPU for encoders

Multipoint Conferencing Unit (MCU)
  Central server receives and composes media streams
    delivers a single output stream to each endpoint
  Every endpoint sends + receives media streams from same server
  Pros
    Cheaper bandwidth
    Traditional enterprise conferencing model
    Better adaptation
      can deliver different stream qualities
    Interoperability with legacy systems
    Sophisticated media processing
  Cons
    More expensive
      need to operate and scale server infrastructure
    Introduces latency
    Traditional enterprice conferencing model

Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)
  Central server receives and forwards
    media streams optimized for each endpoint
  Instead of delivering a single output stream
    delivers output stream optimized for each endpoint
  Pros
    SPU burden on encoder same as MCU
    Publisher bandwith cost same as MCU
    Lightweight on the server
    Adapatation based on client/server logic
      temporal scalability
    Well suited for large scale broadcast
  Cons
    May have to decode multiple streams
    Subscriber cost same as Mesh
    Adaptation may have bandwidth cost
  Mesh + MCU for best of both worlds but costs more $$

Takeaway
  Hybrid SFU with MCU-like capabilities is the way to go
    Why?
      Mobile endpoints
      Legacy hardware
      Media processing + recording
      Broadcasting

Broadcasting Topology
  One to Many (Broadcasting)
    Social apps like Meerkat, Periscope
    Live TV Show
  Few to Many
    Talk show format (host, talent and audience)

OpenTok Platform
  Communications platform
    for embedding video, voice, messaging
      for websites and mobile apps
  Pros
    WebRTC complexities abstracted away
    Global infrastructure ready for scale
    Support for dynamic topologies including multi-party
    Intelligent network adaptation features
      archiving, connectivity tools
