Session Creation Overview
  to connect to OpenTok session
    must specify the id of session we want to connect to
      each session ID identifies a unique OpenTok session
        session is a room where users can meet to chat
  OpenTok sessions do not expire
    authentication tokens do however
    up to the developer to either create a room that lasts longer
      or create a new room for a particular activity

OpenTok Media Router and media modes
  When creating session
    we can specify how the clients will send audio-video streams
      aka media mode, there are two options
        Default is relayed
        Relayed
          Clients will attempt to send audio-video streams directly
            peer to peer
              if this fails, session uses TURN server to relay streams
        Routed
          Uses OpenTok Media Router to route audio-video streams between clients
          Pros
            decreases bandwidth usage in multiparty sessions
            audio fallback and video recovery
            archiving
            group chat with other clients

Best practices when creating sessions
  If there are two participants
   use relayed
  If there are more participants
    and if we want to use the archiving feature
      then use routed sesions
