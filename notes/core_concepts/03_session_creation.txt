  Session is a virtual video chatroom
    connecting to a particular Session is like entering a specific room
    must identify which room to enter
      before we can actually enter it
        must specify the Session to connect to using Session ID
          before we can actually enter it

    but authentication Tokens do
  Cannot explicitly be destroyed

            can ask Session Object what the Session ID is
              then we can serve this Session ID to clients
