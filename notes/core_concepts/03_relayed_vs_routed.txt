Relayed vs. Routed
  We can create two different types of sessions
    Relayed (peer-to-peer)
      clients will attempt to send audio-video streams directly
      no need for an intermediate video server
        latency may be decreased
    Routed (using OpenTok Media Router)
      can decrease bandwidth usage in multiparty sessions
      publishing client only needs to upload one stream to server
        OpenTok Media Router then replicates stream
          down to each subscribing client
        on the other hand, in a relayed session
          publishing clients must send a separate stream
            to each suscribing client
      audio fallback and video recovery
        i.e. if connection is bad then drop the video only
          once it improves bring back the video
      supports archiving feature
        lets you record, save, and retrieve OpenTok session videos
