Unpublishing Your Stream
  Example
    function unpublish() {
      session.unpublish(publisher);
    }
      stops the specified publisher from streaming
        removes local video display from web page
      Session will aslo send streamDestroyed event to all connections
        it will be invoked with a StreamEvent object
      client calling session.unpublish() also recieves streamDestroyed event
        but on its Publisher object

Unsubscribing from a stream
  if a client is subscribing to a stream that gets destroyed
    will want to unsubscribe from that stream
      session.getSubscribersForStream()
        makes it easy to figure out which subscribers
          to pass session.sunsubscribe()
    in the streamDestroyed event listener
      pass in stream contained in StreamEvent object
        to session.getSubscribersForStream()
          the returned Subscriber objects can be passed into
            session.unsubscribe()
              removes video display
                associated with specified subscriber's stream
