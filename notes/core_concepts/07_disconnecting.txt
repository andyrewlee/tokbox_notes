Disconnect from Session
  When user leaves web page through which they were connected to a session
    OpenTok notifies the rest of the Session participants
      that a connection was destroyed
        done via the Session's connectionDestroyed event
          informs other users which user has left by passing ConnectEvent
            contains details about connection that was disconnected
  If User A wants to leave Session without leaving web page
    can call the Session.disconnect() method
      results in User A receiving sessionDisconnected event
        and User B receiving the connectionDestroyed event
          User B will receive the connectionDestroyed event
            whether User A leaves implicitly or explicitly
